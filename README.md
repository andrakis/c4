C4KE - C4 Kernel Experiment
=============================================

c4 was "An exercise in minimalism."

C4KE is "an exploration in over-extending minimalism." It provides a multitasking kernel, shell, compiler, and utilities.

C4KE runs under a modified `c4` interpreter called `c4m`, which itself can be run be in an unmodified `c4` interpreter.
It does however run much faster under a natively compiled `c4m`.


Architecture
------------

C4KE is a pre-emptive multitasking operating system. It uses a cycle-based trap to switch between tasks automatically,
or custom opcodes that can manually switch tasks (cooperative multitasking.)

`c4m` can trap on unknown opcodes, and this feature is used to implement C4KE's extended opcodes. All registers, including
return addresses, can be modified inside these trap handlers. By swapping register values from one task with those from another,
task switching is accomplished transparently to running tasks.

C4KE uses a custom executable format, the [C4 Relocatable](src/c4cc/asm-c4r.c). This format contains symbols and runtime patch information.


Running
-------

To run under the extended `c4m` interpreter, use:

	make run

To run under the original `c4` interpreter, use:

	make run-c4

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for additional `make` targets.

Once in C4KE, type `help` for a command listing, or `ls` to display runnable programs.

Try `bench` or `innerbench` to test out how fast C4KE runs on your system.


C4M?
----

`c4m` is the `C4 Multiloader`, an extended version of [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) which apart from adding a few new opcodes, can also read multiple .c source files sequentially to output a single program.

Changes over C4:

* Designed to run under unmodified C4: any version of `c4` should be able to run `c4m` without changes.

* Designed to be enhanced when compiled natively: basic signal handling is supported (SIGINT), terminal control to come in the future.

* Reads all given source files on the command line, as if they were one big file.

* Related to the above, allows multiple instances of functions and variables to exist. If there are multiple `main`'s, it is the last one seen that gets used. This functionality was a hack to enable modularization before a preprocessor was implemented, and will be replaced by proper preprocessing soon.

* Can use the address of functions (`&func`) to store into `int *` variables.

* Can call C4 functions stored in `int *`: `int *func; func = (int *)&test; func(1, 2);`.

* Trap handlers: C code called when an event occurs. `c4m` additionally supports some POSIX signals, like SIGINT.

* Traps on unknown opcodes for custom handling or new opcodes implemented in C.

* Cycle based trap for task switching.

* Opcodes `JSRI`, `JSRS`: `JSR` variants that use a global variable (`I`) or a stack variable (`S`). Generated by `c4m`.

* Builtin `__c4_opcode`: Allows custom opcodes to be executed, used heavily by [u0.h](include/u0.h).

* Builtin `__c4_jmp`: Unconditional jump to target address, used by [c4ke.c](src/c4ke/c4ke.c) for custom opcode handling.

* Builtin `__c4_adjust`: Adjust the stack manually, allowing stack allocation/deallocation at will.

* Builtin `__opcode`, `__builtin`: Allows querying the interpreter's opcodes and builtin functions.

* Fixes a potential stack overflow when using printf()
